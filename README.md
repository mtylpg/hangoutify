# HANGOUBERTIFY
It's like Spotify for hanging out and like Uber for hanging out.

Cuz planning shit on a small scale fuckin sucks right now, gang.

# STORIES

- I should be able to create a event when I want to do something so I can invite other people
- I should be able to comment on event that exist so I can communicate interest
- I should be able to view comments on a event so I can see what decisions have been made
- I should be able to set a `tl;dr` with basic info for the event so people don't have to read the entire comment history
- I should be able to modify the `tl;dr` for any event I have created
- I should be able to follow an event so I can be notified when things are added to a thread
- I should be able to unfollow an event so I can stop being notified when things are added to a thread I was previously following
- I should be able to check thread status over SMS so I can know what the status of an event is over spotty internet connections
